## 🌿 Project Overview

We are excited to present our graduation project: a system capable of monitoring and protecting plants!

* The project started as a **mobile application** featuring a monitoring system linked to local weather conditions, which can alert farmers if there’s any potential risk to their crops.
* Users can **take photos of their plants** to detect diseases quickly and easily. We also provide additional plant-related data for those interested in learning more.
* To make the system more user-friendly and reduce confusion from general LLMs, we created a **custom AI chatbot** trained specifically on Egyptian plant disease data.
* My role focused on implementing **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LLM technology** for the chatbot.
* In the future, this software could be connected to **hardware systems** to monitor and protect crops autonomously. 💪🌾
